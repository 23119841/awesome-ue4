# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! Here's a quick checklist for you to
run through when thinking through and formulating a contribution:

- [ ] I read and will adhere to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)!
- [ ] I checked the list for an existing entry for the thing I'm adding.
- [ ] I can personally vet the thing I'm adding as high-quality and well-documented.
- [ ] I added the thing in the correct category!
- [ ] I made sure that the thing I added was in alphabetal order.
- [ ] I have properly formatted the line for the thing I'm adding.
  - Example: `[Name](Link) - Description`
- [ ] I have outlined the value of the thing in my pull request.

Please think twice when submitting paid assets. It'd be preferable to keep the
number of paid assets to a minumum to keep things as _accessible_ and helpful as
possible. This policy may shift towards maintaining a list of high-quality
paid assets to reflect that. Part of that process will involve defining what
_high-quality_ as much as possible.

If you've got any questions, feel free to file it via the issue tracker or
contact the maintainer privately via their listed e-mail address, if available.
